=head1 NAME

AnyData2 - access to data in many formats

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.001';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyData2 ();

    my $ad = AnyData2->new( $src_format => { %src_format_flags },
                            $src_storage => { %src_storage_flags } );
    my $ad_out = AnyData2->new( $tgt_format => { %tgt_format_flags },
                                $tgt_storage => { %tgt_storage_flags } );
    while( my $datum = $ad->read ) {
        $ad_out->write( $datum );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rather wacky idea behind this module is that any data, regardless of
source or format should be accessible and maybe modifiable with the same
simple set of methods.

AnyData2 is reduced to the maximum, all extended features like tied access,
import from a different source, automatic conversion on export etc. should
be done in external logic. This will make the core more maintainable.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $af = AnyData->new(
    CSV              => {},
    "File::Linewise" => { filename => File::Spec->catfile( $test_dir, "simple.csv" ) }
  );

Instantiates a combination of AnyData::Storage and AnyData::Parser.

C<AnyData::Parser::> and C<AnyData::Storage::> are automatically prepended
when necessary.

sub new
{
    my ( $class, $fmt, $fmt_flags, $stor, $stor_flags ) = @_;
    $stor =~ m/^AnyData2::Storage::/ or $stor = "AnyData2::Storage::" . $stor;
    $fmt =~ m/^AnyData2::Format::/   or $fmt  = "AnyData2::Format::" . $fmt;
    require_module($stor);
    require_module($fmt);
    my $s = $stor->new(%$stor_flags);
    $fmt->new( $s, %$fmt_flags );
}
