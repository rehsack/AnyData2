=head1 NAME

AnyData2::Format::CSV - CSV format class for AnyData2

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.001';

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

constructs a CSV accessor, passes all options down to C<csv_class> beside
C<csv_class>, C<csv_cols> and C<csv_skip_first_row>. C<csv_class> is used
to instantiate the parser and prefers L<Text::CSV_XS> over L<Text::CSV>
by default.  When C<csv_skip_first_row> is set to a true value, the first
line of the csv isn't used to guess the names in C<csv_cols>. Specifying
C<csv_cols> always wins over any value of C<csv_skip_first_row>.
