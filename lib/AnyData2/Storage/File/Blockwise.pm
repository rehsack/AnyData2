=head1 NAME

AnyData2::Storage::File::Blockwise - AnyData2 file storage ...

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.001';

=head1 METHODS

...

=head2 new

constructs a storage.

=cut

sub new
{
    my ( $class, %options ) = @_;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%options);
    @$self{qw(blocksize)} = @options{qw(blocksize)};
    $self;
}

=head2 read

  my $buf = $stor->read(<characters>)

Use binmode for characters as synonymous for bytes.

=cut

sub read
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $buf;
    my $rc = $self->{fh}->sysread( $buf, $self->{blocksize} );
    defined $rc or die "Error reading from $$self->{filename}: $!";
    $rc > 0 and $rc < $self->{blocksize} and die "Read only $rc bytes from $self->{filename} instead of $self->{blocksize}";
    $buf;
}

=head2 write

  $stor->write($buf)

Writes the buf out

=cut

sub write
{
    my ( $self, $buf ) = @_;
    my $rc = $self->{fh}->syswrite( $buf, $self->{blocksize} );
    defined $rc or die "Error writing to $self->{filename}: $!";
    $rc > 0 and $rc < $self->{blocksize} and die "Wrote only $rc bytes into $self->{filename} instead of $self->{blocksize}";
    "0E0";
}

=head2 rewind

  $stor->rewind

This is similar to C<< $stor->seek( 0, SEEK_SET ) >>.

=cut

sub rewind
{
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{fh}->sysseek( 0, SEEK_SET ) or die "Can't rewind $self->{filename}: $!";
    "0E0";
}
